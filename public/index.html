          The original Broadway musical, which clocks in around two hours and 20
          minutes (whew!), was created by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It lifts most of
          its lyrics from Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, a 1939 book of
          poems by T.S. Eliot. These poems tell the stories of typical cat
          characters, such as “cat that breaks all your shit,” and “cat that
          gets really hyper at night.”The original Broadway musical, which

          Cats debuted in 1981 on the West End. Fun fact, Webber had to
          remortgage his house to secure the funds! The struggle was apparently
          worth it, as Cats won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical.

          An even more fun fact is that there are a lot of cats in the world.
          Very few of them know how to code very well at all. That is OK.
          Someday they too may have access to SDG.
